#### Track your favorite dishes with Dish Tracker
Our Dish Tracker app is designed to help you remeber which dishes you've ordered at your favorite restaurants, so you can continue trying new things instead of falling into the habit of ordering the same dish each visit.

#### How it works
The user is prompted for their location upon entering the homepage. 
The location data is used to pull up restaurants nearby.
The user can then select a restaurant and see additional information such as a link to the full menu, address, phone number, and price range (if available).
Then, the user can select the restaurant and view the clickable menu items which will be stored in the Dishlist for future viewing!

##### Future development
- search by zipcode
- nutrition info per dish
- user uploaded pictures and reviews per dish
- "burn alert"-- let the user mark a dish or restaurant as to avoid it in the future
